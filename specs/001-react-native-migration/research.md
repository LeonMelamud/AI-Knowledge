# Research: React Native Migration

**Generated**: 2025-09-30  
**Purpose**: Technology decisions and best practices for AI Knowledge Base mobile transformation

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Primary Framework Choice
**Decision**: React Native 0.74+ with TypeScript 5.0+  
**Rationale**: 
- Cross-platform development reduces maintenance overhead while preserving native performance
- TypeScript provides type safety critical for educational content accuracy
- Mature ecosystem with excellent community support for required features
- Existing team knowledge in React ecosystem reduces learning curve

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Native iOS/Android development (rejected: resource constraints, duplicate maintenance)
- Flutter (rejected: team expertise, smaller ecosystem for content-focused apps)
- Expo (considered: will use Expo CLI for development builds but not managed workflow)

### State Management Solution
**Decision**: Zustand for global state management  
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and performant for mobile apps
- TypeScript-first design aligns with type safety requirements
- Minimal boilerplate compared to Redux
- Excellent React Native compatibility and offline support

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redux Toolkit (rejected: excessive boilerplate for app scope)
- React Context (rejected: performance concerns with frequent updates)
- Jotai (rejected: learning curve, smaller ecosystem)

### Navigation Architecture
**Decision**: React Navigation v6 with TypeScript support  
**Rationale**:
- De facto standard for React Native navigation
- Excellent deep linking support required for content sharing
- Strong accessibility support for WCAG compliance
- RTL support for Hebrew interface requirements

**Alternatives Considered**:
- React Native Navigation (rejected: steeper learning curve, overkill for app complexity)
- Expo Router (rejected: too new, potential stability concerns)

### Internationalization Strategy
**Decision**: react-i18next with custom RTL handling  
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for React internationalization
- Built-in pluralization and interpolation features
- Strong TypeScript support for translation key validation
- Namespace support for organizing content translations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- React Native Localize only (rejected: insufficient translation management)
- Custom solution (rejected: reinventing proven patterns)

### Data Processing & Storage
**Decision**: Client-side js-yaml processing with AsyncStorage caching  
**Rationale**:
- Maintains YAML-first constitutional principle
- Enables offline functionality without compromising data structure
- Schema validation possible through custom parsing logic
- AsyncStorage provides reliable cross-platform persistence

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Server-side YAML conversion (rejected: violates constitutional principles)
- SQLite local database (rejected: unnecessary complexity for current scope)
- Realm database (rejected: overkill, licensing concerns)

### API Architecture Transformation
**Decision**: RESTful API with existing Node.js/Express backend  
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing backend infrastructure
- REST patterns familiar to team
- Easy to implement offline-first synchronization
- Maintains backward compatibility with web version

**Alternatives Considered**:
- GraphQL (rejected: adds complexity, team unfamiliar)
- Complete backend rewrite (rejected: unnecessary risk)
- Serverless functions (rejected: doesn't serve content-focused architecture)

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Jest + React Native Testing Library + Detox E2E  
**Rationale**:
- Jest is standard for React Native projects
- Testing Library promotes accessibility-first testing
- Detox provides reliable E2E testing for both platforms
- TDD workflow supported with watch mode

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Enzyme (rejected: deprecated, poor React Native support)
- Appium (rejected: more complex setup, slower execution)
- Manual testing only (rejected: violates constitutional TDD requirements)

### Performance Monitoring
**Decision**: Flipper integration with custom performance tracking  
**Rationale**:
- Built-in React Native debugging capabilities
- Network request monitoring for API performance
- Memory usage tracking for constitutional compliance
- Free and well-integrated with development workflow

**Alternatives Considered**:
- React Native Performance Monitor (rejected: limited features)
- Third-party APM (rejected: cost, privacy concerns for educational content)

## Architecture Patterns

### Offline-First Design Pattern
**Decision**: Cache-first with background sync strategy  
**Rationale**:
- Educational content must be accessible regardless of connectivity
- Reduces mobile data usage for users
- Improves performance by reducing network dependencies
- Aligns with mobile-first constitutional principle

**Implementation Approach**:
- AsyncStorage for content caching
- Network status monitoring with NetInfo
- Background synchronization on connectivity restore
- Conflict resolution with server-side precedence

### Component Architecture Pattern
**Decision**: Feature-based folder organization with shared components  
**Rationale**:
- Scales well with app complexity growth
- Clear separation of concerns for maintenance
- Supports parallel development of features
- Facilitates testing isolation

**Structure**:
```
src/
├── components/shared/    # Reusable UI components
├── screens/             # Feature-specific screens
├── services/            # Business logic and API clients
├── store/               # State management
└── utils/               # Pure utility functions
```

### Error Handling Pattern
**Decision**: Centralized error boundary with user-friendly messaging  
**Rationale**:
- Educational apps must maintain user trust through reliability
- Graceful degradation preserves learning experience
- Centralized logging aids in constitutional compliance monitoring

## Development Workflow

### Build and Deployment Strategy
**Decision**: Expo Development Build with EAS Build service  
**Rationale**:
- Streamlined development workflow
- Easy device testing and sharing
- Automated builds for both platforms
- Over-the-air updates for non-native changes

### Code Quality Enforcement
**Decision**: ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript strict mode  
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for code quality gates
- Automated formatting reduces review friction
- TypeScript strict mode catches potential runtime errors
- Consistent code style across team

### Version Control Strategy
**Decision**: Feature branches with constitutional compliance checks  
**Rationale**:
- Maintains code quality through review process
- Automated CI checks ensure constitutional compliance
- Clear feature isolation for testing and rollback

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Platform Fragmentation Risk
**Mitigation**: 
- Target iOS 13+ and Android 8+ for 90%+ device coverage
- Use React Native's built-in platform detection
- Extensive device testing on physical devices

### Performance Risk
**Mitigation**:
- Lazy loading for large content lists
- Image optimization and caching
- Bundle analyzer to monitor size growth
- Performance budgets in CI pipeline

### Accessibility Risk
**Mitigation**:
- Automated accessibility testing in CI
- Screen reader testing on both platforms
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Color contrast validation

### Constitutional Compliance Risk
**Mitigation**:
- Automated checks in PR process
- Regular constitutional review meetings
- Clear documentation of design decisions
- Rollback procedures for violations

## Next Phase Requirements

Based on this research, Phase 1 (Design & Contracts) requires:

1. **Data Model Definition**: Entity relationships for Content, User Preferences, Cache, Bookmarks, App State
2. **API Contract Generation**: RESTful endpoints for news, concepts, tools, search, sync
3. **Component Contract Definition**: Props interfaces for screens and shared components  
4. **Test Scenario Extraction**: Specific test cases from user stories and edge cases
5. **Performance Contract**: Measurable targets for startup, loading, memory usage

All decisions above support constitutional compliance and maintain focus on educational content delivery through mobile-optimized user experience.
