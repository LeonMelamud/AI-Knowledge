## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A mobile user wants to access AI knowledge content (news, concepts, tools) on their smartphone or tablet, with full support for their preferred language (English or Hebrew), ability to work offline, and smooth performance comparable to native mobile apps. The experience should maintain all functionality from the web version while being optimized for mobile interaction patterns.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the mobile app for the first time, **When** they select their preferred language (English or Hebrew), **Then** the entire interface adapts to that language including RTL layout for Hebrew and all content is displayed in the selected language

2. **Given** a user is browsing AI news on mobile data, **When** they lose internet connection, **Then** previously loaded articles remain accessible and the app clearly indicates offline mode without losing functionality

3. **Given** a user wants to find information about machine learning, **When** they use the search feature, **Then** they can search across news, concepts, and tools simultaneously with results ranked by relevance and filtered by content type

4. **Given** a user finds a useful AI concept, **When** they bookmark it for later reference, **Then** the bookmark is saved locally and remains accessible in their favorites section even when offline

5. **Given** a user launches the app on a mid-range smartphone, **When** the app starts up, **Then** the main interface loads within 3 seconds and content appears within 2 seconds

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user switches languages while having bookmarked content? (Language preference applies to interface, bookmarks remain accessible)
- How does the system handle corrupted offline cache? (Automatic cache rebuild from server with user notification)
- What happens during content synchronization conflicts? (Server version takes precedence, user notified of updates)
- How does the app behave on very old mobile devices? (Graceful degradation with core functionality maintained)
- What happens when YAML content structure changes? (Automatic migration with fallback to previous version)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide native mobile applications for iOS and Android platforms that deliver identical functionality to the current web version
- **FR-002**: System MUST support complete English and Hebrew localization including right-to-left (RTL) interface layout for Hebrew users
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to access all previously loaded content when offline, including news articles, AI concepts, and tool descriptions
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide search functionality across all content types (news, concepts, tools) with filtering and sorting capabilities
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to bookmark favorite content items and access them through a dedicated favorites section
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain user preferences (language, theme, notification settings) across app sessions and device restarts
- **FR-007**: System MUST synchronize content updates from YAML files without requiring app updates or user intervention
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide push notifications for important AI news updates while respecting user notification preferences
- **FR-009**: System MUST meet performance targets of 3-second app startup and 2-second content loading on mid-range devices
- **FR-010**: System MUST comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards including screen reader support and keyboard navigation
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve all constitutional principles including content-driven architecture, multilingual excellence, and YAML-first data management
- **FR-012**: Users MUST be able to share content items through native mobile sharing functionality
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide deep linking capabilities for direct navigation to specific content items
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle network connectivity changes gracefully without data loss or user interface disruption
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain content integrity through automatic validation of YAML data structure and schema compliance

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Content Item**: Represents news articles, AI concepts, or tool descriptions with multilingual support, metadata (title, description, tags, publication date), and relationships to other content
- **User Preferences**: Stores language selection, theme preference, notification settings, and accessibility options with automatic synchronization and local persistence
- **Bookmark Collection**: User-curated list of favorite content items with offline access, categorization capabilities, and cross-device synchronization
- **Content Cache**: Local storage of downloaded content with expiration policies, update detection, and automatic cleanup to manage storage space
- **App State**: Current navigation context, search history, recently viewed items, and session data with state restoration capabilities
