# Implementation Plan: React Native Migration

**Branch**: `001-react-native-migration` | **Date**: 2025-09-30 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-react-native-migration/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Transform the AI Knowledge Base from a web-based application to cross-platform React Native mobile apps (iOS/Android) while maintaining all functionality including multilingual support (English/Hebrew with RTL), offline capabilities, search across content types, and constitutional compliance. Technical approach uses React Native with TypeScript, client-side YAML processing, and RESTful API transformation.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: React Native 0.74+ with TypeScript 5.0+, Node.js 18+ for backend API  
**Primary Dependencies**: React Navigation v6, Zustand, react-i18next, AsyncStorage, js-yaml  
**Storage**: AsyncStorage for local data, YAML files for content, optional Redis for API caching  
**Testing**: Jest + React Native Testing Library, Detox for E2E, performance monitoring with Flipper  
**Target Platform**: iOS 13+, Android 8+ (API 26+), cross-platform React Native  
**Project Type**: Mobile + API - React Native app with transformed REST API backend  
**Performance Goals**: <3s app startup, <2s content loading, 60fps UI, <150MB memory usage  
**Constraints**: Offline-capable, RTL Hebrew support, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, constitutional compliance  
**Scale/Scope**: ~15 screens, 1000+ daily users, multilingual content, 50MB app bundle limit

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Content-Driven Architecture**: ✅ PASS - Mobile app enhances content accessibility by providing native mobile experience, improved search across content types, offline reading, and mobile-optimized navigation. All features serve educational content consumption.

**Multilingual Excellence**: ✅ PASS - Full English/Hebrew localization maintained with react-i18next, complete RTL interface support for Hebrew, cultural considerations in mobile UX design. Language switching preserves all app state.

**Test-First Development**: ✅ PASS - TDD approach documented with Jest/React Native Testing Library for units, contract tests for API endpoints, integration tests for YAML processing, performance tests for startup/loading times, accessibility tests automated.

**YAML-First Data Management**: ✅ PASS - Preserves YAML files as source of truth, client-side processing with schema validation, no changes to existing YAML structure, content editors maintain direct file access without technical intervention.

**Performance & Accessibility**: ✅ PASS - Targets <2s content loading, implements WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with screen reader support, keyboard navigation, mobile-first responsive design optimized for touch interfaces.

**Structure Decision**: Mobile + API pattern selected. React Native app in `mobile/` directory with cross-platform source code, platform-specific builds in `android/` and `ios/`. Transformed REST API in `api/` directory maintains existing YAML data structure in `public/data/`. This separation allows independent development and deployment while preserving constitutional data management principles.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
