  - name: Weights and Bias
    shortDescription: Adjustable parameters in neural networks that affect learning and predictions.
    imageUrl: ./css/Weights_and_bias.png
    fullDescription: |
      Weights and Bias are central parameters in neural networks and machine learning models:

      - Weights:
      - Represent the strength of connections between neurons in the network.
      - Are updated during the training process to improve the model's accuracy.
      - High values indicate high importance of a particular input, low values indicate low importance.
      - Proper initialization of weights is important for fast and efficient network convergence.

      - Bias:
      - Allows the network to learn and represent more complex functions.
      - Shifts the activation function left or right, allowing the network to better fit the data.
      - Helps the network deal with situations where all inputs are zero.
      - Serves as an "initial value" or "threshold" that the input needs to exceed for a "neuron" to activate.

      Importance and Challenges:
      - Learning: Weights and biases are updated during training to minimize the loss function.
      - Representational Power: They allow the network to learn and represent a wide range of functions.
      - Initialization Challenges: Choosing appropriate initial values for weights and biases is important for convergence.
      - Vanishing/Exploding Gradients: Inappropriate weights can cause problems in gradient flow.
      - Overfitting: Excessively large weights can lead to overfitting to the training data.

      Optimization techniques like Gradient Descent, Adam, and RMSprop focus on efficient updating of weights and biases 
      to improve model performance.

      Image Explanation:
      The image demonstrates the basic structure of a single neuron in a neural network:
      - Inputs (x₁, x₂, x₃, ..., xₘ) are represented by blue circles on the left side.
      - Weights (w₁, w₂, w₃, ..., wₘ) are represented by gray arrows connecting the inputs to the neuron.
      - The neuron itself (the green circle) performs a weighted sum of the inputs and adds the bias: Σ(wᵢxᵢ) + bias.
      - The activation function (the pink rectangle) applies a non-linear transformation to the weighted sum.
      - The output (ŷ) is represented by the orange circle on the right side.

      The image illustrates how weights and bias influence the processing of information in a neuron, and how the activation function introduces non-linearity to the model, allowing the network to learn and represent complex functions.

      2. Computes the error in the output layer.
      3. Moves backward through the network, computing the contribution of each weight to the final error.

      - Softmax: used in the output layer for multi-class classification.

  - name: Overfitting and Underfitting
    shortDescription: Conditions of over-learning or under-learning from training data.
    fullDescription: |
      Overfitting and Underfitting are two central challenges in machine learning:

      - Overfitting:
        - The model "learns" too much from the training data, including noise and outliers.
        - Manifests in excellent performance on training data, but poor performance on new data.
        - Reason: The model "memorizes" the training data instead of learning general rules.

      - Underfitting:
        - The model is too simple and fails to learn the complexity of the data.
        - Manifests in poor performance on both training data and new data.
        - Reason: The model is unable to capture the complexity of the problem.

      Techniques to address these issues:
      - For Overfitting:
        1. Increasing the dataset size
        2. Regularization (L1, L2)
        3. Dropout (in deep learning)
        4. Early Stopping
        5. Cross-validation

      - For Underfitting:
        1. Increasing model complexity
        2. Feature engineering
        3. Reducing regularization
        4. Training for a longer time

      The right balance between Overfitting and Underfitting is key to creating models that generalize well to new data.
