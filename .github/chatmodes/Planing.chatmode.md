# Project Planning Mode

A comprehensive planning mode that follows structured methodology for project analysis, technical design, and implementation planning. Based on spec-driven development principles adapted for the AI Knowledge Base project.

## Planning Workflow

### Phase 0: Requirements & Analysis
```
1. Analyze current project state and context
2. Identify feature requirements and constraints  
3. Research technical decisions and dependencies
4. Document unknowns and clarification needs
5. Establish success criteria and acceptance tests
```

### Phase 1: Technical Design
```
1. Define system architecture and data models
2. Create API contracts and interface definitions
3. Plan integration points and dependencies
4. Design test strategy and validation approach
5. Update project structure and file organization
```

### Phase 2: Implementation Planning
```
1. Break down work into actionable tasks
2. Establish task dependencies and ordering
3. Identify parallel execution opportunities
4. Create timeline and resource estimates
5. Define completion criteria and deliverables
```

## Project Context Awareness

### Current Architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express server (`server.js`)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with modular design (`public/js/`)
- **Data Layer**: YAML configuration files (`public/data/`)
- **Content**: Multilingual support (English/Hebrew)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with custom domain
- **Integrations**: RSS feeds, AI APIs, token counting

### File Structure Understanding

## Planning Templates

### Feature Planning Template
```markdown
# Feature Plan: [FEATURE_NAME]

## Requirements Analysis
- **Primary Goal**: [What we're trying to achieve]
- **User Stories**: [Who, what, why scenarios]
- **Acceptance Criteria**: [How we measure success]
- **Constraints**: [Technical/business limitations]

## Technical Design
- **Architecture**: [High-level system design]
- **Data Model**: [Entities, relationships, storage]
- **API Design**: [Endpoints, contracts, schemas]
- **Integration Points**: [External dependencies]

## Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1**: [Setup and foundation]
- **Phase 2**: [Core functionality]  
- **Phase 3**: [Integration and testing]
- **Phase 4**: [Polish and deployment]

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: [Complexity, unknowns]
- **Timeline Risks**: [Dependencies, blockers]
- **Mitigation Strategies**: [How we handle risks]
```

### System Improvement Template
```markdown
# System Improvement: [IMPROVEMENT_NAME]

## Current State Analysis
- **Existing Implementation**: [What we have now]
- **Pain Points**: [What's not working well]
- **Performance Metrics**: [Current measurements]
- **User Feedback**: [Known issues/requests]

## Proposed Solution
- **Approach**: [How we'll improve it]
- **Benefits**: [Expected improvements]
- **Trade-offs**: [What we sacrifice/gain]
- **Success Metrics**: [How we measure improvement]

## Migration Strategy
- **Backward Compatibility**: [Maintaining existing functionality]
- **Rollout Plan**: [How we deploy changes]
- **Rollback Plan**: [How we undo if needed]
- **Testing Strategy**: [How we validate changes]
```

## Constitution Principles

All planning follows these principles for the AI Knowledge Base:

### Code Quality Standards
- **Maintainability**: Code should be readable and well-documented
- **Modularity**: Components should be loosely coupled and highly cohesive
- **Testing**: All features need validation and error handling
- **Performance**: Optimize for user experience and resource efficiency

### User Experience Guidelines
- **Accessibility**: Support for screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Internationalization**: Maintain English/Hebrew language support
- **Responsiveness**: Work well on mobile and desktop devices
- **Loading Performance**: Fast initial load and smooth interactions

### Technical Standards
- **Security**: Validate inputs, sanitize outputs, secure API endpoints
- **Scalability**: Design for growth in content and user base
- **Compatibility**: Support modern browsers and development environments
- **Documentation**: Keep code comments and documentation current

## Integration with Other Modes

### With @spec-kit Mode
- Use for formal specification creation (`/specify`, `/plan`)
- Leverage constitution and template system
- Follow structured development methodology

### With @tasks Mode  
- Execute planned tasks through automation
- Validate implementation against requirements
- Monitor progress and completion status

## Example Workflows

### Planning New Feature
```
@planning analyze requirements for semantic search functionality
→ Requirements analysis and constraint identification

@planning design architecture for search integration  
→ Technical design and system integration plan

@planning create implementation plan for search feature
→ Detailed task breakdown and execution strategy
```

### Improving Existing System
```
@planning analyze current hot news system performance
→ Current state assessment and improvement opportunities

@planning design enhanced news categorization system
→ Architecture improvements and data model changes  

@planning create migration plan for news system upgrade
→ Safe deployment and rollback strategy
```

## Notes
- All planning artifacts are stored and version-controlled
- Plans integrate with existing project structure and conventions
- Planning considers both immediate needs and long-term maintainability
- Regular plan reviews ensure alignment with project goals
